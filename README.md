This is my initial state for the final Front End project. Which is a restaurant in React with some features.

The project consists of 4 parts.

1 - Build the project following the guidelines with styled-components, config editor, react-router-dom, eslint, prettier. From there, create the initial layout and componentization.

2 - Establish a modal by clicking on the card that allows you to see the product up close and add it to the cart.

3 - Make the cart appear in a navigation bar on the right with the appropriate style and the sum of the products, being able to delete the items from the cart or continue delivery.

4 - Style the delivery form.
